##### Templating Needed:

* The above sketches are intended for download via the **device-cloud web UI**. Hence, the *.h* files have got *template* matching strings for **DEVICE_OWNER, DEVICE_ID** & **DEVICE_TOKEN**. 

Hence, if using these sketches seperately, please change those *#define macros* appropiately before burning to an arduino .

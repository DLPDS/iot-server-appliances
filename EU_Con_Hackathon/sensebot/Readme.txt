Step 1 - provided the sketch to control the sensebot using serial communication
Step 2 - provided the sketch to control the sensebot using wifi communication
Step 3 - provided the jax-rs implementation to expose the apis of the sensebot (This has included the bam configuration)
Step 4 - provided the sketch to retreive sensor data from the sensebot - without motor controller
Todo - merge Step 4 (to retreive sensor data) and step 1 and make the sensebot to move with predefined commands while gathering the data.
